INGREDIENTS
Cheruparippu (moong dal) - 100 gm (approximately 1 cup)
Grated coconut - ? - ½ cup
Jeera - ½ tsp
Green chilli - 2-3
Turmeric powder - ¼ ts
Ghee/coconut oil - 2-3 tsp
Water - ½ ltr
Small onion - 3-4
Mustard seeds - a pinch
Red chilli - 2
Curry leaves

INSTRUCTIONS
Grind together coconut, jeera, green chilli and turmeric powder with 1 tbsp water to a smooth paste. Roast the moong dal in a heavy bottomed pan (without oil).
Boil half a litre water and add the roasted dal to this. Cook till the dal is done. Mash it well or you can just run it in a food processor or blender for a few seconds. Add ground paste, salt and ½ - 1 cup water to the mashed dal and let it boil. Remove from heat.
Heat oil/ghee in another pan and splutter mustard seeds. Add small onion, curry leaves and red chilli. Fry till small onion becomes golden brown. Pour over cooked dal. Serve with rice and pappad, wait... don't start eating... drizzle some ghee on the curry, now you are ready to eat :)

NOTES
You can also cook the dal using pressure cooker. Cook on high flame for 5-6 whistles. keep it closed for 10-15 mins and open the cooker. 
I recommend using ghee for this recipe.
